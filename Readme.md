circuito.io
===========

* Circuito.io is a system for generating a circuit schematic & accompanying code samples.
Circuito.io generate the schematic & code based on your selection of micro-controller, i/o and power devices.

* For more information, see the website at: http://circuito.io
You can also like circuito.io on Facebook at: https://www.facebook.com/circuito.io

* for any question on the code or layout, please don't hesitate to contact us at hello@circuito.io.

* Once you've worked the schematics & code, please take the time to give us some [feedback](https://circuito.typeform.com/to/pfKypx), so we can keep improving and give you an even awesomer service!


How to read this repository
---------------------------
You are here because you used circuito.io and asked for a circuit and code sample for your project.
This is your project folder, you'll find here:
* firmware folder - includes all code need to operate the i/o devices using the micro-controller. firmware.ino is the main logic file, but to operate the code you'll need all files in your sketch.
* PCB folder - where you'll find the schematic diagram and breadboards view as a Fritzing file, and as two jpg files.
